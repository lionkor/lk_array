# `lk_array` - A simple dynamic C array

`lk_array` is a simple, dynamically self resizing array class for C.

It's written with simplicity and safety in mind, and comes with error reporting builtin.
Allows for bound-checking safe access, resizing, reserving, iteration, custom allocators, *any* size data, and so much more!
Error handling is made easy with a builtin error reporting callback and sane error behaviour (no assert's, segfaults, etc).

All it takes is adding `lk_array.c` and `lk_array.h` to your project!

**Comes with tests!**
